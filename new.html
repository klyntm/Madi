          First of all, Im so sorry for everything i did love, i know you don't deserve to be treated like that, you don't deserve to be ignored, to make you cry,
          to make you feel sad, etc. I'm sorry if I'm not always by your side when you're feeling down, sorry if I make you feel like you're just a second option, I didn't mean to make you feel that way, love, and I'm so sorry.
            Also, I apologize for not giving you my time and attention. It's okay if you don't forgive me love i understand, just don't forget that i always love you from the first day we met until now.
            I promise that i won't do it again LOVE. And I LOVE YOU SO MUCH LOVE! ALWAYS AND FOREVER!.
